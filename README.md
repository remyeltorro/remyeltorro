### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm RÃ©my, a fresh PhD in biophysics with a strong interest in image treatment, data analysis and interfacing. I am looking for a job! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Celldetective](https://github.com/remyeltorro/celldetective)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of LLMs


#### The answer to the question you never intended to ask

âš¡ TorrÃ³ is a turron in Catalan, where I suspect my last name comes from. I couldn't resist being named after such a nice sweet, hence my pseudo RÃ©my the turron.
