### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm RÃ©my a PhD student at the Adhesion & Inflammation lab in Marseille, France. I love to collaborate with fellow researchers on image analysis and quantification problems. Currently, I am putting all of my energy in a software designed for the comparison of biological conditions at single cell resolution, accessible to biologists, bringing together recent developments in bioimage analysis and some of my own tricks: the upcoming CellDetective. 

#### The answer to the question you never intended to ask

âš¡ TorrÃ³ is a turron in Catalan, where I suspect my last name comes from. I couldn't resist being named after such a nice sweet, hence my pseudo RÃ©my the turron.
